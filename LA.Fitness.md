LA Fitness's brand archetype, fitness brands often align themselves with archetypes such as the Hero (empowering individuals to achieve their fitness goals), the Sage (providing expert guidance and knowledge), or the Everyman (making fitness accessible to everyone).

Sales Funnel Stages: 

LA Fitness likely employs various marketing and promotional activities to attract potential customers, nurture their interest, encourage consideration of membership options, facilitate the conversion process, and then focus on member retention through exceptional service and ongoing engagement.

BANT Strategies: 

Budget: LA Fitness would assess whether potential customers have the financial means to afford a gym membership. This could involve offering various membership options at different price points to cater to a range of budgets. LA Fitness may also provide special promotions or discounts to make their memberships more affordable and attractive. 

Authority: LA Fitness would determine if the potential customer has the authority to make the decision to join the gym. For example, they may inquire if the individual is making the decision for themselves or if they need to consult with someone else, such as a spouse or family member. LA Fitness may provide information or incentives to encourage decision-makers to support the membership enrollment. 

Need: LA Fitness would focus on understanding the potential customer's fitness goals and 
needs. This could involve conducting a needs assessment or consultation to determine what the individual wants to achieve through their fitness journey. LA Fitness may then highlight how their facilities, services, and programs can meet those specific needs, whether it's weight loss, strength training, cardiovascular fitness, or overall wellness. 

Timeline: LA Fitness would inquire about the potential customer's timeline for joining or starting a fitness program. They may ask questions like when they plan to start their fitness journey or if they have any upcoming events or goals they want to prepare for. Understanding the timeline allows LA Fitness to provide tailored recommendations and assistance to help individuals get started at the right time and stay motivated.
