Our ideal customer is someone with a strong drive for fitness and health. The people who come to our gym are striving to meet a goal of a certain physical attribute for themselves.
For this, the customer needs all the equipment and support they can get from us. This will come in the form of all the best equipment for all types of people, guided and free weights for all body types
They will also have facilities like a pool for swimming, a track for running(indoor and/ or outdoor), and a basketball court to help with cardio and physical activities.
In addition to these, we will have personal trainers, who will help people stay aligned and give all the assistance they need.


The behavior of the people who will be our customers will be driven and willing, no matter what is driving them they will have a drive to meet their fitness goals and become better versions of themselves.
This behavior is important for all people who want to improve themselves because these people will also create an atmosphere that will attract others who want the same thing. This will exponentially grow, making for more members 
to have this drive and work ethic.

The motivation of our customers is for them to reach their fitness goals. We want them all to reach their goals and then make new ones so that they will have  something to strive for. This makes for big and major improvements for these individuals.
Another motivator is to witness others meet their goals alongside them. This will help them see that they can also strive for their goals and big things. This motivator will be prevalent in all our workers and customers so they can bet the best they can be

There will be a ton of high-end equipment, and the customers will have access to most if not all for very reasonable prices, which will make for big things for them. These low prices will be not only to their liking but will add to the reciprocity, making them want to give back by returning to the gym. Every customer will have the authority to do what they need to so long they abide by the guidelines we have set in place. This plays a part in commitment, we are committed to giving them the best experience, which does rub off on people, making them want to give that back in return. There may be many other places that give the need that we are fulfilling, but none will do it as efficiently as we are, the way we do it will create large levels of social proof, which will show that many people want to come to our gym and it will show that we are one of a kind in many ways. The final point is timing, We will be available at all times, making it so that no matter what the schedule we will have something for them. Not all facilities will be open at all times, but most of them will be, making for the utmost optimal experience for the users.
