Brand Archetypes:

Planet Fitness fits under the everyman archetype, this company is very much hampered by the fact that they accept everyone into their gym and market this heavily. This is shown through their commercials where they come off as extremely welcoming to people from all walks of life and levels of fitness. They use the colors Purple and Yellow, to express that everyone is royalty in their own light and has the right to reach their fitness goals

Sales Funnel Structure
They attract Customers through their ads. The Everyman archetype is very good at doing this as it proves that anyone can get fit if they truly want to. Interest will build when they see not only can they join this gym that should be judgment-free, but they will also be able to do it for a very low price when they look things up. This is where there is a jump from Intrest to Desire, where they will continue to compare this to other gyms, making it so they see how big of a difference there is in terms of pricing and acceptance, especially as a beginner. This is where they close the deal, and make for major pushes to make action and hit the gym.
