Brand Archetypes:

Planet Fitness fits under the everyman archetype, this company is very much hampered by the fact that they accept everyone into their gym and market this heavily. This is shown through their commercials where they come off as extremely welcoming to people from all walks of life and levels of fitness. They use the colors Purple and Yellow, to express that everyone is royalty in their own light and has the right to reach their fitness goals

Sales Funnel Structure:

They attract Customers through their ads. The Everyman archetype is very good at doing this as it proves that anyone can get fit if they truly want to. Interest will build when they see not only can they join this gym that should be judgment-free, but they will also be able to do it for a very low price when they look things up. This is where there is a jump from Intrest to Desire, where they will continue to compare this to other gyms, making it so they see how big of a difference there is in terms of pricing and acceptance, especially as a beginner. This is where they close the deal, and make for major pushes to take action and hit the gym.

BANT Strategy:

Budget: 10 dollars for the base membership monthly with a ten-dollar startup fee. the PF black card has a one-dollar startup fee and a 25-dollar per month. Both come with a 49-Dollar annual fee
Authority: Planet Fitness is a judgment-free zone, so the most authority over what happens is up to the members. There may arise a situation where a member needs a guardian to allow them to have a membership
Need: The need for Planet Fitness is to solve the health needs of all of its members and help them meet their fitness goals
Timeline: The timeline is totally based on the user

Persuasion Methods:
They use the arts of Consistency, Liking, and Social Proofing the most as arts of persuasion. They are consistent in their message, and not only that without consistency results cannot be made in the gym, so that also plays a part. When it comes to liking, they show that you are always welcome, showing that you are capable of being here, and that you are wanted here. There is also social proofing that comes in with the judgement-free zone.
